"""Registry of user-installed Click packages.

Click packages are installed into per-package/version directories, so it is
quite feasible for more than one version of a given package to be installed
at once, allowing per-user installations; for instance, one user of a tablet
may be uncomfortable with granting some new permission to an app, but
another may be just fine with it.  To make this useful, we also need a
registry of which users have which versions of each package installed.

We might have chosen to use a proper database.  However, a major goal of
Click packages is extreme resilience; we must never get into a situation
where some previous error in package installation or removal makes it hard
for the user to install or remove other packages.  Furthermore, the simpler
application execution can be the better.  So, instead, we use just about the
simplest "database" format imaginable: a directory of symlinks per user.
